# Speech-to-text-scraping

Created a command line tool to transcribe the the input audio file. The user can use the sppech to text services given by the Wit.ai(Acquired by facebook). The command line tool has the support of 30 languages (https://wit.ai/faq).

The user have to input the three arguments as language code(for which language user want to transcribe.). The second argument as source directory in which audio files are present. And the third argument as the destination directory in which the transcribe output json file will be there.
